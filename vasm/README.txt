This directory contains binaries for the vasm assembler for all x64 platforms. These binaries came from http://www.compilers.de/vasm.html, and they are redistributed for the mod to easily download them upon first time use.

Note: vasm is under their own license, located in section 1.2 of their vasm manual: http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/release/vasm.html
It is not under the same license as the mod.
